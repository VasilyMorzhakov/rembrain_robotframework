class WsRobotProcess(RobotProcess):
    """
    Process that communicates with a remote websocket server.
    Pulling/pushing data between the program and the weboscket exchange.

    This is the process you should be using if you want to set up distributed processing of your robot's functionality.
    For example, you can have your robot push the video feed to the websocket server, and then have an ML-capable PC
    pull the video feed and perform the ML processing, sending back commands for robot to execute.

    Args:
        **[Required]** command_type: Either `pull` or `push`. Pull to get data from the remote exchange.
        Push to push data to the exchange.

        **[Required]** exchange: Name of the exchange the data should be pushed/pulled from.

        url: Websocket gate URL. If not specified, `WEBSOCKET_GATE_URL` env var is used.

        robot_name: Robot, for which we are pushing/pulling data. If not specified, `ROBOT_NAME` env var is used.

        username: Username of user to log in into the exchange. If not specified, `RRF_USERNAME` env var is used.

        password: Password of user to log in into the exchange. If not specified, `RRF_PASSWORD` env var is used.

        data_type: (For pull commands) Determines how the binary data from the exchange should be processed.
        The output from the WsRobotProcess to the queues will be of the according data_type.
        Possible values (default: binary): `["json", "binary", "bytes", "str", "string"]`.

        ping_interval: Interval between pings that are being sent to the exchange in seconds. Default value: 1.0

        connection_timeout: Timeout for opening connection to the exchange in seconds. Default value: 1.5
